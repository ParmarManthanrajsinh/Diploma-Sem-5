**3. Different leadership models (overview + when to use & strengths/weaknesses)**

Leadership theories give frameworks for how leaders behave and influence people. Short summaries:

**a. Trait theory**

* *Idea:* Leaders possess innate traits (confidence, intelligence).
* *Strength:* Highlights important leader attributes.
* *Weakness:* Inconsistent—traits alone don’t guarantee leadership success.

**b. Behavioral theory**

* *Idea:* Effective leadership depends on behaviors (task vs people orientation).
* *Strength:* Actionable — leaders can learn behaviors.
* *Weakness:* Context (situation) also matters.

**c. Contingency (Situational) theory**

* *Idea:* Best leadership style depends on situation (task complexity, follower maturity). Examples: Fiedler, Hersey-Blanchard.
* *Strength:* Practical—matches style to context.
* *Weakness:* Can be complex to diagnose the situation correctly.

**d. Transformational leadership**

* *Idea:* Leaders inspire, motivate, create vision and change.
* *Strength:* Drives innovation, high commitment.
* *Weakness:* Requires strong charisma and follow-through.

**e. Transactional leadership**

* *Idea:* Focus on exchanges (rewards/punishments) to manage performance.
* *Strength:* Clear, efficient for routine tasks.
* *Weakness:* Less effective for change or creativity.

**f. Servant leadership**

* *Idea:* Leader serves employees, prioritizes their growth.
* *Strength:* Builds trust, engagement, long-term loyalty.
* *Weakness:* Can be slower in decision-making for urgent crises.

**g. Charismatic leadership**

* *Idea:* Leader’s personal charm drives loyalty and vision.
* *Strength:* Inspires followers strongly.
* *Weakness:* Can create dependency; risk if leader fails.

**When to use which model:**

* Stable operations → transactional or behavioral/task-oriented.
* Change/innovation → transformational or charismatic.
* Teams needing empowerment → servant or situational (adjust level of direction/support).

**4. Functions of Management — definitions, processes, merits & demerits**

Management is commonly broken down into five core functions: **Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Directing (Leading), Controlling**. Below each is explained with objectives, key activities and merits/demerits.

---

**4.1 Planning**

* **Definition:** Determining objectives and selecting the best courses of action to achieve them.
* **Steps in planning:** Set objectives → analyze environment → identify alternatives → evaluate & choose best alternative → prepare plans & budgets → implement and review.
* **Types:** Strategic, tactical, operational, contingency.
* **Objectives:** Reduce uncertainty, coordinate activities, provide direction, allocate resources efficiently.
* **Merits:** Clarifies goals, avoids waste, improves coordination, proactive problem solving.

* **Common structures:** Functional, divisional (by product/geography), matrix, team-based, flat/hierarchical.
* **Objectives:** Efficient resource use, clear authority-responsibility relationships, coordination.
* **Merits:** Specialization → efficiency; clear hierarchy → accountability; scalable systems.

* **Merits:** Ensures objectives are achieved, minimizes deviations, improves efficiency.
* **Demerits:** Over-control reduces creativity, costly to implement, may create resistance if used punitively.

---

**4.5 Staffing — Recruitment and management of talent**

**6. Differences between Management and Administration**

| Aspect            |                      Administration | Management                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Focus             |   Policy-making, setting objectives | Implementing policies, achieving objectives           |
| Level             |           Top-level (owners, board) | All levels (especially middle & lower for operations) |
| Nature            | Conceptual, determines “what to do” | Executive, deals with “how to do it”                  |
| Decision type     |                Strategic, long-term | Operational, short- to mid-term                       |
| Skills emphasized |          Visionary, decision making | Technical, interpersonal, supervisory                 |
| Authority         |                 Broad, policy-level | Delegated authority for implementation                |
| Example roles     |        Board of directors, trustees | Managers, supervisors, team leaders                   |

**Short take-away:** Administration decides the **what** and **why** (policy & objectives); Management decides the **how** and **who** (execution & supervision).
