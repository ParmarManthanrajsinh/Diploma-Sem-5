# 🏗️ JSP Architecture (MVC Model)

JSP (JavaServer Pages) applications commonly follow the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** design pattern.  
This pattern separates the **business logic**, **presentation**, and **control flow**, making web applications more **scalable, maintainable, and efficient**.

---

## 1️⃣ Components of JSP MVC Architecture

### **Model (M)**
- Represents the **business logic** and **data** of the application.
- Usually implemented using **JavaBeans, POJOs, or EJBs**.
- Handles database interactions via **JDBC** or frameworks like Hibernate.
- **Example**: A `User` JavaBean that fetches and stores user details from the `users` table.

---

### **View (V)**
- Represents the **presentation layer**.
- Implemented using **JSP pages**.
- Displays data to the user (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- JSP should **not** contain complex business logic, only presentation.
- **Example**: `profile.jsp` that shows user profile details.

---

### **Controller (C)**
- Acts as the **request handler**.
- Implemented using **Servlets**.
- Receives client requests, calls the Model for processing, and forwards results to the View.
- **Example**: `LoginServlet` validates user credentials and forwards the request to `welcome.jsp`.

## 2️⃣ Workflow of JSP MVC Architecture

1. **Client Request** → The user sends an HTTP request (e.g., login form submission).  
2. **Controller (Servlet)** → Interprets the request and invokes the Model.  
3. **Model (Java Classes / Beans)** → Executes business logic, queries the database, and prepares data.  
4. **Controller Updates View** → Passes processed data to the JSP page.  
5. **View (JSP Page)** → Generates dynamic HTML and sends the response to the client browser.

## 4️⃣ Advantages of JSP MVC Architecture

✅ **Separation of Concerns** → Business logic (Model) is isolated from presentation (View).  
✅ **Reusability** → The same business logic can be used across multiple views.  
✅ **Maintainability** → UI changes do not affect business logic and vice versa.  
✅ **Scalability** → Ideal for enterprise-level applications.

## 📝 Perfect Exam Answer

**JSP Architecture** is based on the **MVC pattern**:  
- **Model** → Manages business logic and database interaction.  
- **View** → Handles presentation using JSP pages.  
- **Controller** → Manages control flow using Servlets.  

👉 The client request is first handled by the Controller, which interacts with the Model and forwards results to the View.  
Finally, the View (JSP) generates a dynamic response (HTML/JSON/XML).  

This architecture ensures **better maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns** in web applications.
